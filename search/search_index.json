My name is Juan Guajardo and this is my portfolio of quantitative projects, ranging from simple visualizations to implementations of state-of-the-art models.</p> <p>If you're here, that probably means you're interested in some of my results because you're a recruiter or you're looking to use my projects as a reference. In any case, I invite you to look at the navigation tabs where I divide my projects in three main sections: </p> <p>1. For recruiters: Here you'll find an example of some of the most common recquirements for positions such as Data Scientist, Data Analyst, or Quantitative Researcher. This is intended to provide you with a general overview of my skills. Here's also my resume\u00e9. </p> <p>2. Deep Dives: Here you'll find a deep explanation of some of my most complex projects, in a way that you can appreciate the extent of my knowledge. Note that this is not extensive on the topics that I'm familiar with, but a taste of how I can manipulate or apply models in general for very specific objectives. </p> <p>3. Toy Projects: Here I'll be posting stuff that is not intended to convince you of anything but just to share the things that I build with my free time.</p>"},{"location":"#check-out-my-projects","title":"Check out my projects","text":"<ol> <li>The International Effects of The Fed's UMP : Academic Project where I apply a VAR (Vector Autorregression) to investigate the effect of the Fed's UMP on the Mexican Economy</li> </ol>"},{"location":"international_ump_effects/readme/","title":"The International Effects of the UMP Implemented by the Federal Reserve","text":"<p>Hi!
