My name is Juan Guajardo and this is my project portfolio. It will range from simple visualizations to implementations of state-of-the-art models.</p> <p>If you're here, that probably means you're interested in my projects because you're a recruiter or you want to use them as reference. In any case, I invite you to look at the navigation tabs where I divide my projects in three main sections: </p> <p>1. For recruiters: Here you'll find an example of some of the most common recquirements for positions such as Data Scientist, Data Analyst, or Quantitative Researcher. This is intended to provide you with a general overview of my skills. Here's also my resume\u00e9. </p> <p>2. Deep Dives: Here you'll find a detailed explanation of selected projects. This is intended for a technical audience. </p> <p>3. Toy Projects: Just sharing the things that I build in my free time. </p> <p>Please be aware that I just started to build this site a few days ago, so there's still much to be added. You'll see many projects have empty pages. Come back in a few days, I'll be posting frequent updates and populating those pages. At the moment, only the one you see below is available (and I'm still working on it) </p>"},{"location":"#check-out-my-latest-projects","title":"Check out my latest projects","text":"<ol> <li>The International Effects of The Fed's UMP : Here I apply a VAR (Vector Autorregression) to investigate the effect of the Fed's UMP on the Mexican Economy.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"international_ump_effects/readme/","title":"The International Effects of the Fed's UMP","text":"<p>Hi!

Well, with the risk of oversimplifying, the Fed is in charge of two things: reaching maximum employment and keeping stable prices (low inflation). This is also known as \"dual mandate.\" The set of tools that the Fed can use to reach its objectives is calles the Monetary Policy.</p> <p>Now, if there's an Unconventional Monetary Policy, that implies that there's also a Conventional Monetary Policy. The \"Conventional\" Monetary Policy is the set of tools that the Federal Reserve usually applies to reach its goals. That's basically the short term interest rate. The Fed buys and sells short term government bonds to influence its prices and therefore their interest rate. When the short term interest rate moves, it generates a chain reaction in the financial system that spreads through several channels and into the real economy.</p> <p>But, what happens when the interest rate is really close to zero? This situation was believed to be the limit of the monetary policy tools to influence the economy. When the interest rate reached the zero lower bound (ZLB) during the Great Financial Crisis, the unconventional monetary policy (UMP) made its appearance.</p> <p>This new tool (at least for the Fed) allowed the Federal Reserve to buy not only short term bonds, but also long term bonds and virtually any asset class. So it wouldn't influence only the short term interest rate, but also longer parts of the interest rate curve. This received the name of \"Quantitative Easing\" a.k.a. throwing money from helicopters (figuratively). In addition, the announcements made by the Fed contained information about the future monetary policy decisions with the objective of manipulating the market expectations about the future interest rates. This one is called \"Forward Guidance.\"</p> <p>Those are the two main tools of Unconventional Monetary Policy.</p>"},{"location":"international_ump_effects/readme/#how-can-we-measure-these-effects","title":"How can we measure these effects?","text":"<p>When investigating this policies, the researchers stumbled upon the problem of measuring the stance of the monetary policy since the short term interest rate was pretty much fixed at the ZLB, but they knew the Federal Reserve was aggressively expanding their monetary policy. Some used the long term interest rate, some used the size of the balance sheet of the Fed, and so on it goes the list. There isn't still a consensus about which metric to use, but the Wu-Xia shadow short rate seems to be a promising alternative. In simple terms, it tries to estimate the value that the short term interest rate would have in the abscence of the zero lower bound. In theory, it's build to capture also the effects of the market expectations, so we should be able to measure both, the quantitative easing and the forward guidance. In this exercise, this is the variable we will use to measure the monetary policy stance.</p>"},{"location":"international_ump_effects/readme/#data","title":"Data","text":"<p>For our model, we will treat the Mexican economy as a small open economy, that is influenced by a big open economy, namely the US.</p> <p></p> <p>To describe the macroeconomic dynamic of the Mexican economy, we will choose indicators to measure the income</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"international_ump_effects/readme/#the-mexican-economy-endogenous-variables","title":"The Mexican Economy: Endogenous Variables","text":"<p>Text.</p> <p>Text.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"international_ump_effects/readme/#the-us-economy-exogenous-variables","title":"The US Economy: Exogenous Variables","text":"<p>Text.</p> <p>Text.</p>"},{"location":"international_ump_effects/readme/#empirical-estimation","title":"Empirical Estimation","text":""},{"location":"international_ump_effects/readme/#frequentist-model","title":"Frequentist Model","text":"<p>Insert Econometrics.</p>"},{"location":"international_ump_effects/readme/#bayesian-model","title":"Bayesian Model","text":"<p>Insert Bayesian Model.</p>"},{"location":"international_ump_effects/readme/#results","title":"Results","text":"<p>Impulse-response functions and discussion.</p>"},{"location":"international_ump_effects/readme/#conclusions","title":"Conclusions","text":"<p>Conclusions.</p>"},{"location":"international_ump_effects/readme/#appendix","title":"Appendix","text":""},{"location":"international_ump_effects/readme/#model-testing","title":"Model testing","text":"<p>Unit roots, etc.</p>"},{"location":"international_ump_effects/readme/#structural-breaks","title":"Structural Breaks","text":"<p>Markov Switching</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"recruiters_overview/readme/","title":"Work in Progress...","text":"<p>Hi!
