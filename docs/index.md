## **Overview**

Hello! My name is Juan Guajardo and this is my project portfolio. It will range from simple visualizations to implementations of state-of-the-art models.

If you're here, that probably means you're interested in my projects because you're a recruiter or you want to use them as reference. In any case, I invite you to look at the navigation tabs where I divide my projects in three main sections:
</br></br>

**1. For recruiters**: Here you'll find an example of some of the most common recquirements for positions such as Data Scientist, Data Analyst, or Quantitative Researcher. This is intended to provide you with a general overview of my skills. Here's also my [resumee](recruiters_overview/elements/Resume%20Juan%20Antonio%20Guajardo.pdf).
</br>

**2. Deep Dives**: Here you'll find a detailed explanation of selected projects. This is intended for a technical audience.
</br>

**3. Toy Projects**: Just sharing the things that I build in my free time.
</br></br>

<font color=#e92063>**Please be aware that I just started to build this site a few days ago, so there's still much to be added. You'll see many projects have empty pages. Come back in a few days, I'll be posting frequent updates and populating those pages. At the moment, only the one you see below is available (and I'm still working on it)**</font>
